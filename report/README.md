# Index: Biped Locomotion Project Report

This folder contains the complete documentation for the "Constraint-Aware MPC and RL for Bipedal Locomotion" coursework.

## Files
1.  [01_system_overview.md](./01_system_overview.md) - Introduction, Objectives, and Simulation Setup.
2.  [02_algorithms.md](./02_algorithms.md) - Detailed breakdown of the MPC formulation, QP Solver, and RL strategies.
3.  [03_results.md](./03_results.md) - Analysis of the ATP (Acceptance Test Procedure) results and Baseline vs. RL comparison.
4.  [04_future_work.md](./04_future_work.md) - Limitations and roadmap for future improvements.

## Quick Start
To regenerate all results described in this report:
```bash
cd v2
./run_finalization.sh
```
This will produce a `results/` folder containing the Plots, Logs, and Videos cited in Section 3.
